2. Communications between laptop and Ultra96 [Live + Video]
Explain and demo ssh tunnelling to Ultra96 [2]
Walk through code and explain concurrency/threading of code on laptop and Ultra96 (if any) [2]
Demo successful communications between ONE laptop to Ultra96 with dummy data [3]


RelayLaptopClient(threading.Thread):

__init__(self, stu_username, stu_password, ultra96_port_num, player_num)

- initialise threading superclass
- create client socket
- set server_address
- set player number (player number tied to port number)
- set shutdown event flag

open_tunnel(self)

- docs: https://sshtunnel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- ssh_address_or_host is IP and Port of REMOTE GATEWAY
- remote_bind_address is IP and Port of REMOTE CONNECTION
- local_bind_address is default ('0.0.0.0', RANDOM_PORT)
- block on close???

- tunnel_one 
- REMOTE GATEWAY = (stu, port 22)
- REMOTE CONNECTION = (ultra96, port 22)

- tunnel into stu? ultra96 ssh port 22 on stu?

- tunnel_two
- REMOTE GATEWAY = (localhost, tunnel_one_local.bind_port)
- REMOTE CONNECTION = (localhost, ultra96 port num)

- tunnel through tunnel_one onto ultra96
- return tunnel_two.local_bind_address

send_sensor_data(self, action)

- create dummy data dict
- data packet include player_num, data_type and data_value
- if action is shield, grenade, reload or logout, data_type is IMU, dummy data values for if-else check on FPGA on ultra96
- if action is shoot, data_type is GUN, value is 1 for shot fired
- if action is hit, data_type is VEST, value is 1 for shot hit
- currently undecided on bluetooth information
- else to capture all bad action commands, discard at ultra96, can send action again
- jsonify data and encode in utf-8
- send to ultra96 similar to eval_server to ultra96 Len_JSON

stop(self)

- close client socket 
- set shutdown event_flag

run(self)

- open tunnels and ssh onto ultra96
- connect to relay laptop server on ultra96
- while shutdown event flag not set
- wait for action input to generate dummy data
- if done, stop, close connection and shutdown
- else send data to ultra96
